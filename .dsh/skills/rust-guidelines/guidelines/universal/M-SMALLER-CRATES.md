## If in doubt, split the crate (M-SMALLER-CRATES) { #M-SMALLER-CRATES }

<why>fast compile times and good modularity.</why>

You should err on the side of having too many crates rather than too few, as this leads to dramatic compile time improvements—especially
during the development of these crates—and prevents cyclic component dependencies.

Essentially, if a submodule can be used independently, its contents should be moved into a separate crate.

Performing this crate split may cause you to lose access to some `pub(crate)` fields or methods. In many situations, this is a desirable
side-effect and should prompt you to design more flexible abstractions that would give your users similar affordances.

In some cases, it is desirable to re-join individual crates back into a single _umbrella crate_, such as when dealing with proc macros, or runtimes.
Functionality split for technical reasons (e.g., a `foo_proc` proc macro crate) should always be re-exported. Otherwise, re-exports should be used sparingly.
